How to Use the Chatbot

Once the chatbot is running, here’s how you can interact with it: 
1.	Before starting make sure your microphone is working properly

2.	At the starting the chatbot will automatically turn on speak button to listen to your input so you do NOT need to click on speak button (with an image of a microphone) 

1.  Speak to the chatbot: The chatbot listens for your voice commands.
   -  Click on the "Speak" button to activate the microphone and give voice commands

NOTE:- Speak only after the chatbot says “Listening for input..”
  
2.  Choose an Option: After greeting the chatbot, you'll be presented with two main options:
 -  New Product: Learn about Securova's new home security products
 - You can either:
-  Buy the Product: Get to know product info and choose pricing, availability, and delivery options to place an order
 -  Know More: Learn more about the product, pricing, and availability without purchasing.
-  Customer Support: Get help for existing products, such as troubleshooting, requesting repairs, or replacements.

3.  Click on the Option Buttons: To select an option:
   -  Double-click on the buttons that appear after the bot responds

NOTE:- To give voice inputs instead of clicking on options speak the text written on options (eg: the bot gives options “Buy now” and “Know more” – to select know more click on speak button on right corner and after the bot prints “Listening for input..” say “know more”)

There is a video file also in the same folder named as “chatbot guide.mp4”
